luaglew: use OpenGL in lua5.2

Version
=======

Currently, only OpenGL 2.1 is (partially) implemented.
3.x and 4.x will come later.

How to build
============

**requirements**: dynamic-build lua (Windows: like one from LuaBinaries) and glew

* Windows: you can just type Make if you have all requirements
* Linux: Compile gl.cpp with lua5.2 and glew

How to use
==========

* Move the .dll/.so near your lua file
* Use with `local gl = require('luaglew')`

Documentation
=============

See gl.cpp, but there is a few things to know:

* functions don't have the gl prefix. If importing like in the "How to use" section, you just do: *gl.FunctionName*
* defines are not modified: i.e. *gl.GL_MODELVIEW*
* most functions (mostly the ones without a pointer parameter) are 1-to-1 with the C API.
* suffixes are dropped
    * when there are several versions, only the double or the float is used: no more *glColor3\*()*, only *gl.Color3(double, double, double)* exists.
    * when there is only one version, remove the suffox: glGetQueryiv() become gl.GetQuery()
* vectors versions are not available: no *glColor3\*v()*
* functions filling an array, instead return a lua table: *void glGenTextures(GLsizei, GLuint\*)* --> *table gl.GenTextures(int)*
* all glGet(Integer/Boolean/Float/Double)v are merged into: *value/table gl.Get(type, pname)*.
    * *type* is *GL\_FLOAT*, *GL\_DOUBLE*, *GL\_BOOL* or *GL\_INT*.
    * *pname* is the same as the C param (i.e. *GL_DEPTH_RANGE*, *GL_CURRENT_COLOR*, etc.).
* Most function taking a pointer are not implemented. They are available in lua, but will raise an exception if used.

TODO
====

* finish to implement OpenGL 2.1
* finish to implement glu
* implement glX
* check parameter count
* some functions like *glIndexPointer* can have parameters with multiple meanings(?), i.e.:
```
	If a non-zero named buffer object is bound while a color index array is specified, *pointer* is treated as a byte offset into the buffer object's data store
```
how to manage those things??? (i.e. *I need help*)
